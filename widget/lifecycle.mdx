The Transcrypts verification widget is a secure iframe-based UI that the SDK injects into your page. When your application calls `verify()`, the SDK creates a full-viewport overlay containing the widget. The widget guides users through employment verification and communicates results back to your application.

Your application never interacts with the widget DOM directly — all communication happens through the SDK's event system and the `verify()` promise.

## Verification Flow

```
verify() called
  |
  v
SDK creates a secure session and opens the widget overlay
  |
  v
Widget sends "ready" event
  |
  v
Widget fetches user data (loading spinner shown)
  |
  v
Widget sends "loaded" event
  |
  v
User reviews profile and work experience list
  |
  v
User clicks VERIFY on a job --> verification options modal
  |
  v
User selects verification method --> job marked as verified
  |
  v
User clicks Continue
  |
  v
Widget sends "verification_complete" event with results
  |
  v
SDK cleans up the overlay and resolves the verify() promise
```

## Step-by-Step Detail

<Steps>
  <Step title="Session Creation">
    The SDK creates a secure session with the provided API key and verification parameters.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Widget Display">
    The SDK creates a full-viewport overlay and loads the verification widget inside it. Body scroll is locked while the widget is open.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ready Signal">
    Once the widget has initialized, it signals that it is ready.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Loading">
    The widget fetches user data and employment records. A loading spinner is displayed during this phase.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interactive Review">
    The widget renders the user profile, work experience cards, and a progress bar. The user can click VERIFY on any job to open the verification options modal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verification">
    The user selects a verification method. The job is marked as verified in the widget UI and the progress bar updates.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    The user clicks Continue. The SDK receives the verification results, cleans up the overlay (with a fade-out animation), restores body scroll, and resolves the `verify()` promise with a [`VerificationResult`](/sdk/types#verificationresult).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Events During the Lifecycle

You can subscribe to events emitted during the widget lifecycle using the [`on()`](/sdk/transcrypts-class#oneventtype-callback) method:

```typescript
const transcrypts = new Transcrypts({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });

transcrypts.on('ready', () => console.log('Widget is ready'));
transcrypts.on('loaded', () => console.log('Widget loaded'));
transcrypts.on('verification_started', () => console.log('Verification started'));
transcrypts.on('verification_complete', (event) => {
  console.log('Verification complete:', event.payload);
});

const result = await transcrypts.verify({ ssn: '123-45-6789' });
```

See [Widget Events](/widget/events) for the full list of event types and their payloads.
