## Iframe Overlay

The widget renders inside a fixed-position overlay that covers the full viewport.

### containerStyle Override

You can customize the overlay container styles by passing `containerStyle` when constructing the SDK:

```typescript
const transcrypts = new Transcrypts({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  containerStyle: {
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)',   // Darker backdrop
    zIndex: '1000000',                         // Higher z-index
  },
});
```

The `containerStyle` option accepts a `Partial<CSSStyleDeclaration>` object. These styles are merged on top of the defaults, so you only need to specify the properties you want to override.

See [TranscryptsOptions](/sdk/types#transcryptsoptions) for the full list of default container styles.

### z-index Considerations

The default `z-index` of `999999` is intentionally high to ensure the widget renders above most application content. If your application uses z-index values in this range (for modals, dropdowns, or other overlays), override it via `containerStyle`:

```typescript
containerStyle: {
  zIndex: '2147483647',  // Maximum 32-bit integer
}
```

## Body Scroll Lock

While the widget is open, the SDK prevents the page from scrolling behind the overlay. Scrolling is restored automatically when the widget closes.

## Animation

The overlay fades in when opened and fades out when closed for a smooth user experience.

## Widget UI States

The widget progresses through four states:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Loading">
    Displayed immediately after the widget loads. Shows a centered spinner and "Loading verification..." text. This state is active while the widget fetches user data and employment records.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review (Interactive)">
    The main interactive state. Displays:

    - **Header** -- TransCrypts logo and branding.
    - **Progress bar** -- Shows `{verified}/{total}` jobs verified, with an animated fill bar.
    - **User profile card** -- Full name, email, date of birth, and masked SSN.
    - **Credential banner** -- Appears for the current employer if a TransCrypts credential is detected. Includes a "Share Credential" button that instantly verifies the current job.
    - **Current Employment section** -- Cards for active jobs, each with a VERIFY button.
    - **Previous Employment section** -- Cards for past jobs, each with a VERIFY button.
    - **Footer** -- "Data encrypted & secure" badge and a Continue button.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Success">
    Displayed after verification completes. Shows a green checkmark icon, "Verification Complete" heading, and a confirmation message.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error">
    Displayed when an error occurs. Shows a warning icon, "Verification Error" heading, and the error message.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verification Methods

When the user clicks VERIFY on a work experience card, a modal dialog presents four verification options:

| Method | ID | Description | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SSA Integration** | `ssa` | Verify through Social Security Administration records for historical employment. | ~5 min |
| **Previous Payroll** | `payroll` | Connect to the previous payroll provider for employment verification. | ~3 min |
| **Open Banking** | `banking` | Securely connect a bank account to verify historical income deposits. | ~3 min |
| **Upload Documents** | `upload` | Upload a W-2 form or paystub from the employer to verify employment. | ~2 min |

<Tip>
SSA Integration is marked as "Recommended" with a highlighted card and badge in the modal.
</Tip>

The user selects one option, and the corresponding job is marked as verified in the widget.

Each work experience card displays:

- Company logo placeholder (or icon)
- Company name and position title
- Date range (formatted as `"Mon YYYY -- Mon YYYY"` or `"Mon YYYY -- Present"`)
- A "Current" badge for active employment
- VERIFY button (or a green "Verified" badge once complete)

## Closing the Widget

The widget can be closed in three ways:

| Method | Result |
|---|---|
| **Backdrop Click** | Clicking the semi-transparent backdrop area outside the widget closes it. |
| **Escape Key** | Pressing the Escape key closes the widget. |
| **Verification Complete** | The widget closes automatically after the verification flow completes or fails. |

In all cases, the `verify()` promise resolves with the appropriate result. If the user closed the widget manually, the result will have `success: false` with error code `USER_CLOSED`.

```typescript
{
  success: false,
  verified: false,
  error: {
    code: 'USER_CLOSED',
    message: 'User closed the verification widget',
  },
}
```
