description: "Employment verification made simple. Integrate Transcrypts into your application with just a few lines of code."
---

The Transcrypts SDK lets you add employment verification to any web application. It uses a secure iframe-based widget, works with any JavaScript framework, and ships as a ~5KB package with full TypeScript support.

```typescript
import { Transcrypts } from 'transcrypts';

const transcrypts = new Transcrypts({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
const result = await transcrypts.verify({ ssn: '123-45-6789' });

if (result.verified) {
  console.log('Verified!', result.workExperience);
}
```
