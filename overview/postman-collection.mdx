The Transcrypts Postman Collection offers a solution for getting started with your integration with little to no code needed.

## Setting Up Postman

### Initial Steps

1. **Install Postman** - Download from [Postman's official site](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

2. **Import the Collection** - Fork the Transcrypts API collection using the "Run in Postman" button available in the documentation

3. **Configuration** - After importing both the collection and environment variables, proceed to configure your API credentials

## Configuring Postman

The collection utilizes Postman's environment variables feature to streamline API requests.

### Configuration Steps

1. Select the Development environment from the top-right corner
2. Click the eye icon to access environment settings
3. Enter your credentials from the Transcrypts Dashboard:
   - `client_id`
   - `access_key`
4. Save your changes to begin making API requests

## Making Requests

The collection includes pre-configured scripts for both request setup and response handling to facilitate data flow between sequential calls.

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Create an Order** (VOIE Basic)
   - Response includes a `shareURL` for completing the order

2. **Retrieve Order Details**
   - Uses the `orderId` variable from the initial request

3. **Fetch VOIE Report**
   - Automatically passes through `user_id` and `voie_report_id` variables from previous responses
