This documentation covers the API Reference sections with details and descriptions for the Transcrypts platform. For inquiries, contact support@transcrypts.com or access the Dashboard.

## Supported Environments

Transcrypts operates across two environments:

- **Development**: For live credential testing; limited to 50 successful Tasks without billing
- **Production**: For production use; each successful Task incurs charges

All API requests use the base URL `https://prod.transcrypts.com/v1/` regardless of environment. The Access secret determines which environment processes each request.

## Authentication

### API Keys

The Transcrypts API requires valid credentials consisting of:

| Value | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `client_id` | Private team identifier | `dd21ca23c12142b6a0970b1e0afedf16` |
| `access_secret` | Environment-specific private key | `dev-a57b3109f1f4a8b3f2ebbc1c526950f1795464af` |

The `client_id` remains constant across environments. The `access_secret` differs for each environment with prefixes: `dev` or `prod`.

### Required Headers

Every API request requires:

- `X-Access-Client-ID`: Contains the Client ID
- `X-Access-Secret`: Contains the Access secret

<Warning>
API keys provide access to sensitive data. Store these values securely within your application backend.
</Warning>

## Protocols

Transcrypts uses REST API frameworks with these specifications:

- Responses in standard JSON format
- HTTPS TLS v1.2+ required (HTTP and earlier TLS versions unsupported)
- Requests must include `Content-Type: application/json` header with valid JSON body only

## Security

Manage identifier values from Transcrypts Bridge and API endpoints to maximize security. These values associate API and provider events with requests and assist support teams with issue resolution.

<Warning>
Ensure `access_token` values remain backend-only and never exposed client-side. Store tokens securely and associate them with application users.
</Warning>

### Additional Access Tokens

Users with multiple data provider accounts and Links may create multiple `access_token`s.

## Errors

### HTTP Status Codes

- `2xx`: Successful requests
- `4xx`: Invalid inputs or state violations
- `5xx`: Rare server errors

### Response Code Reference

| Code | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 200 | OK | Request successful |
| 201 | Created | Resource created successfully |
| 400 | Bad Request | Unacceptable request |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid credentials |
| 403 | Forbidden | Permission denied |
| 404 | Not Found | Resource unavailable |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | Unsupported request method |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | Server cannot match acceptable values |
| 410 | Gone | Bridge token expired |
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | Invalid payload format |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded; `access_token` allows one initial and three refresh requests per 24 hours |
| 50x | Internal Server Error | API error |

### Error Message Format

Response bodies contain:

- `code`: Error source
- `message`: User-facing issue description
- `invalid-params`: Form field errors with `field` parameter for UI display

### Error Code Types

- `validation_error`: Invalid input format or missing required fields
- `expired_token`: Public token expired after 6 hours
- `incorrect_token`: Public or access token cannot be matched in storage

## Rate Limiting

The API allows up to 300 requests per minute per Access secret key. Exceeding this limit returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Contact support@transcrypts.com to request limit increases.
