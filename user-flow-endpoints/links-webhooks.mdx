## Overview

This page documents webhook payloads for Account Links, covering three primary event types that occur during the link lifecycle.

## Link Connected

**Event Type:** `link-connected`

The `link-connected` event is triggered when a Link object is initially created. It displays the status of the first related Task once that status reaches `done`.

}
```

## Link Disconnected

The `link-disconnected` event fires when refresh Tasks associated with a Link fail or return with an error condition.

}
```

## Link Deleted

**Event Type:** `link-deleted`

The `link-deleted` event occurs when Links are deleted and all personal data from the connection, including credentials, are permanently removed.

### Sample Payload
