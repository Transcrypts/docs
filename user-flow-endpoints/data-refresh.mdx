description: "Refresh data from an existing Link without re-entering payroll credentials"

## Overview

Refresh data from an existing Link with the data refresh endpoints. These let the user bypass entering their payroll credentials a second time.

## Steps to Perform a Data Refresh

1. **Optional**: Subscribe to webhooks for completed tasks with `done` status, then retrieve payroll data from the refresh information.
2. Use the [Create a data refresh task](/user-flow-endpoints/refresh-task-create) endpoint with the `access_token` from the original connection.
3. Monitor refresh status using webhooks, the [Retrieve a data refresh status](/user-flow-endpoints/refresh-task) endpoint, or both.

## Rate Limiting

Transcrypts enforces strict rate limits on `access_token` values. Within any 24-hour period, only one initial request and three subsequent refreshes are permitted. Exceeding this threshold triggers the error: "Refresh limit for the access_token exceeded."

<Note>
Each data refresh Task is billed individually.
