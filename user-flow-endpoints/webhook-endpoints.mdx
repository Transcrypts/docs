## Overview

Webhooks enable real-time notifications from the Transcrypts platform to your application. When specific events occur -- such as successful account connections or newly added pay statements -- the system sends POST requests to your configured URL with event payload information.

To use webhooks, you need a publicly accessible URL endpoint. Create a webhook configuration using that URL to begin receiving event notifications.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| id | string | Unique webhook configuration identifier |
| name | string | Public webhook configuration name |
| webhook_url | string | URL where event data is sent |
| events | string | Connected event types list |
| env_type | bool | Environment: `production` or `development` |
| created_at | string | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| updated_at | string | ISO 8601 update timestamp |

## Webhook Request History

### Overview

Review and debug webhook delivery attempts using the request history endpoint. This helps you confirm delivery attempts, investigate failures, correlate attempts with internal logs, and audit recent activity.

<Note>
