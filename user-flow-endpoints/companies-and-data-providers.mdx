## Overview

A **Company** represents an organization where a user works and receives income. Transcrypts Bridge prompts users with company search as a default after opening. The complete list of supported companies is available on [the Transcrypts Coverage page](https://transcrypts.com/coverage/).

Company search functions independently when a company ID is passed into Transcrypts Bridge, allowing users to bypass the search process entirely.

**Data Providers** represent user data storage systems. Each company has one Data Provider in mapping use cases.
