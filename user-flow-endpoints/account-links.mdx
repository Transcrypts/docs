## Overview

Links have an ID value and an `access_token`. Together, these retrieve data from a user's account. Exchange the `public_token` value during authentication while implementing Transcrypts Bridge. Access tokens are for sensitive operations, such as generating reports.

## Link Attributes

The following table describes Account Link properties:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
