## What is mTLS?

Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security protocol that enhances the standard TLS protocol by requiring both the client and the server to authenticate each other using digital certificates.

### Key Features of mTLS

1. **Two-Way Authentication**: Both client and server present certificates to verify identities.
2. **Secure Data Transmission**: All communication is encrypted, protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or tampering.
3. **Trusted Certificates**: Certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities establish trust between parties.

### Why Use mTLS?

mTLS provides a higher level of security by combining encryption with mutual authentication, making it ideal for securing APIs, webhooks, and sensitive data exchanges.

## How mTLS Works

1. **Certificate Exchange**: Both the client and server exchange certificates to verify their identities.
2. **TLS Handshake**: A secure handshake is performed, generating session keys for encrypted communication.
3. **Encrypted Communication**: All data exchanged is encrypted, ensuring privacy and integrity.

## mTLS for Public APIs

To ensure secure access to Transcrypts's public APIs, mTLS is implemented for the following endpoints:

| Environment | Endpoint |
|-------------|----------|
| Production | `api-mtls.transcrypts.com` |
| Sandbox | `api-sandbox-mtls.transcrypts.com` |

### Steps to Connect

#### 1. Generate a Private Key and CSR

Use supported formats (X.509v3, RSA/ECDSA keys, SHA256). Include details like common name, organization, and location.

Example CSR format:

```
CN: api-mtls.<name>.transcrypts.com
O: Transcrypts Inc
L: Miami
ST: Florida
C: US
```

#### 2. Submit CSR to Transcrypts

Transcrypts will issue a signed certificate valid for one year.

#### 3. Connect to API

Use the signed certificate and private key to authenticate.

```bash
curl --cert $CERT.pem --key $PRIVATE_KEY.key $URL
```

#### 4. Work with Transcrypts Support

Complete setup and enable for your account.

#### 5. Update Firewall Configuration

Allow the following IP addresses for Transcrypts's mTLS endpoints:

**Production:**

- `35.167.32.174`
- `35.165.53.192`
- `54.71.147.242`

**Sandbox:**

- `44.235.37.104`
- `35.83.220.165`
- `52.38.209.190`

#### 6. Use Transcrypts's Client ID and Access Key

Reference the API Keys documentation for details.

## mTLS for Webhooks

Transcrypts supports mTLS for webhook communication, ensuring secure and trusted data exchange between Transcrypts and its clients.

### Webhook Authentication Options

#### Using Transcrypts's Signed Certificate

Transcrypts provides a public certificate (domain: `mtls-prod.transcrypts.com`) that clients can configure on their server to establish an mTLS connection.

#### Using Client-Signed Certificate

Transcrypts can submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the client. The client issues a signed certificate, which Transcrypts uses along with the private key for authentication.

### Originating IP Address

Refer to the [Webhooks](/docs/platform-management/webhooks) documentation for information about IP addresses in use for webhooks. Some clients will require explicit configuration to enable access by Transcrypts.

### Configuring Custom Headers for Webhooks

Transcrypts allows clients to configure custom headers when invoking webhooks. This can include passing a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for additional authentication. Work with Transcrypts to configure these settings.
