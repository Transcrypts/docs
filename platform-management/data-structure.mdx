## Overview

The Transcrypts API enables users to establish connections with data sources like payroll providers and create Links to manage data retrieval and modifications.

The workflow begins by generating a Bridge token and creating a user. Customers then use Transcrypts Bridge to connect with one or more data providers.

## Connecting to Providers

When users attempt to connect to a data provider, the system generates a Link object. A Task object subsequently initiates processing for the requested action. Each Task progresses through distinct stages in the connection lifecycle with specific status updates.

For successful Tasks, data from providers can be accessed through these endpoints:

- Identity Profile
- Employment
- Pay Statements
- Bank Accounts
- Shifts
- Reports

### Link Structure

Link ID values combine data source and user credentials. Each Link has an associated data provider ID. Successful connections include an Identity object retrieved from the data provider.

Multiple employment objects are available from data providers, reflecting accounts with:

- Multiple pay statements
- Multiple bank accounts
- Multiple tax documents
- Multiple shifts
