## Overview

Bank Integration allows verifiers to confirm a user's income by analyzing deposit history from their bank accounts. Instead of relying solely on payroll data, this method connects directly to a user's bank to identify income deposits, detect pay frequency, and calculate average earnings over configurable time periods.

## How It Works

1. **User opens Bridge** -- The user launches the Bridge widget and selects their bank from the list of supported institutions.
2. **User authenticates** -- The user enters their banking credentials to authorize access.
3. **Transaction data is pulled** -- Transcrypts retrieves transaction history from the connected bank account.
4. **Income deposits are identified** -- The system analyzes transactions to isolate income-related deposits and categorize them by source.
5. **Bank Income Report is generated** -- A structured report is produced containing deposit patterns, frequency analysis, and income summaries.

<Info>Bank Integration is particularly useful when payroll provider access is unavailable or when additional income verification is needed alongside payroll data.</Info>
