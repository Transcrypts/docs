## Overview

When a user has previously completed verification through Transcrypts, their credentials are securely stored. Verifiers can request fresh employment or income data for that user without requiring them to go through the full Bridge flow again. This enables faster, frictionless re-verification using existing connections.

## How It Works

1. **Verifier submits a request** -- Create an Order or VOIE report for a user who has previously connected through Bridge.
2. **Transcrypts checks stored credentials** -- The system looks up whether valid credentials exist for that user's payroll or bank provider.
3. **Data is refreshed automatically** -- If the stored credentials are still valid, Transcrypts connects to the provider and pulls the latest data without any user interaction.
4. **Expired credentials are handled gracefully** -- If credentials have expired or been revoked, the user may be prompted to re-authenticate through Bridge.
5. **Fresh data is returned** -- Updated employment and income data is delivered through the standard API endpoints.

<Info>Stored credentials are encrypted at rest and in transit. Transcrypts never exposes raw credentials through the API.</Info>

## Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Faster verification | Skip the Bridge flow entirely when credentials are still valid |
| Reduced friction | Users are not asked to re-enter information they have already provided |
| No user action needed | In most cases, the re-verification completes without any user involvement |
| Always fresh data | Each re-verification pulls the latest data directly from the provider |

## API Flow

Use the Data Refresh endpoints to trigger a re-verification with stored credentials:

1. Call the **Refresh Task Create** endpoint with the user's existing `link_id`.
2. Monitor the task status until processing completes.
3. Retrieve the updated data using the standard employment or income endpoints.

<Warning>If stored credentials have expired, the refresh task will return a status indicating that user re-authentication is required. In this case, redirect the user to Bridge to reconnect.</Warning>
